 I will inquire. We really need to roll out the feature showing why an account was suspended or visibility filtered (aka ghostbanned). Will happen in Jan.

 Cocaine does not meet that test
" To assess if a drug is good, whether legal or illegal, the acid test is being able to say: [blank] made me a better person."
" I am not endorsing drugs, but I am saying that the evidence suggests that banning them is a net societal negative"
 Banning alcohol caused the biggest rise in organized crime in American history. That was dumb.Same logic applies to other drugs. Alcohol is just a legacy drug.

 Anyone who says that questioning them is questioning science itself cannot be regarded as a scientist

 Exactly. Why would anyone trust corpo journalism?
 The legacy media should worry about its reputation. We have only just begun.

" Despite these glaring issues, Twitter nonetheless had an internal Slack channel unironically called ‚ÄúFauci Fan Club‚Äù ü§Ø"

 Even solar plus batteries on a small section of Spain would solve EU energy needs
 How did this shift happen? Feels like the conventional media used to be more balanced.
" Yeah, legacy media just tell you what you already learned on Twitter several days earlier. Much of the time, they are literally writing stories based on tweets!"
Why is corporate journalism rushing to defend the state instead of the people?
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be the clown on the clown car!‚ÄùToo late haha

" Most people don‚Äôt appreciate the significance of the point Matt was making: *Every* social media company is engaged in heavy censorship, with significant involvement of and, at times, explicit direction of the government.Google frequently makes links disappear, for example."

 1. The message is actually still up. This is fake news.2. Twitter doesn‚Äôt prevent suicide.

Fractal of Rube Goldberg machines ‚Ä¶
" I was invited to WEF, but declined"
" True, ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù professors are the root of this evil"
 Almost no one understands
 You can also now play all Steam games on the latest Model S/X cars
 That and several major UI improvements coming in Jan
" To be clear, I am overall very much pro FBI. The agency does a great deal of important work protecting the public. That said, no organization is perfect and part of the FBI obviously overreached with respect to online censorship."
 St Peter‚Äôs is an incredible work of art
Twitter votes for the right haha
 Person liking it decides
 Dan is basically an unpaid intern on our QA team lol
 Interesting. Allowing a user to make any given like public or private is coming.
" Views shows how alive Twitter is! And hopefully encourages people to tweet more often, rather than operate in read-only mode."
 Do you prefer your nightmare rectangle with 1cm or 2cm radius corners?
So you‚Äôre saying you prefer the right? Heheh
 Spaces should automatically ask the host if they‚Äôd like to save it
" Instagram is an underpaid, online modeling agency"
 There definitely need to be more reactions
 Likes should be private by default
Tweet impression count should
" NY Times is simply outputting short summaries of articles, which then hit a paywall for non-subscribers. They would have far more views if they interacted with readers on Twitter and allowed at least the first few paragraphs to be read by non-subscribers."
Tweets are read ~100 times more than they are liked
 Looking into it. That tweet doesn‚Äôt violate ToS.
Congratulations Tesla Team!!
" Everyone, just like video view count"
 It‚Äôs not out of the question
" But shouldn‚Äôt there be some funding in this bill to secure US borders, given that we are spending tens of billions to secure the borders of other countries?"
"Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video.Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don‚Äôt tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions."
" What utter insanity that tens of billions are being spent for border security of other countries, but none for ours!!"
" At the risk of being repetitive, these Fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever"
 Should we keep it going?
One of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter! Nice work by Twitter team.
. &amp; the public has spoken. They are overwhelmingly against this giant spending bill.
 This philosophy is the death of humanity
Sustainable cars powered by sustainable energy
 No oversight!? That sounds as fishy as the random $60M allocation in this bill for Salmon.

 We were on a Hotz streak! ü•Å
" Maybe so, in which case ‚Ä¶ buying opportunity!I keep saying that Fed rate is insane, because data I‚Äôm seeing says we‚Äôre already in deflation. If true, then real rate of return of T-bills is roughly that of S&amp;P500.Very smart investor I spoke to today said he‚Äôs shorting S&amp;P‚Ä¶"
 Saturn V was an incredible machine
" The kids I talked to just had one request, which was to hug this guy who keeps trying to hug me in SF. I checked to see if they were sure about that and they were, so I will."
" A nice trick question is what color is the sun?It appears white in space, but, as measured by peak photon count, it is green."
 They saw this coming in the 70‚Äôs!
" For a moment there, I almost considered not giving him 5 stars!"
"I‚Äôm in favor of a small spending bill to keep things running, but common sense suggests that it be the least amount required through the holidays. Railroading through a giant spending bill that almost no one has read is unlikely to be in the best interests of the people."
 Sorry to hear this. It is a sobering reminder of the difficulty of orbital space flight.
 There are no angels in war
"I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams."
"Whether for or against, please let your elected representatives know what you think about this $1.7 trillion spending bill that they‚Äôre trying to pass!"
 And at least one plankton
" Funds for borders of other countries, but not ours? Is that for real?"
 Caring more about words than actions does not bode well for civilization
 Satire and reality have merged!
" Guaranteed, not one person voting for it has read the whole thing. If we added that basic requirement, legislation would improve dramatically in favor of the people."
Should Congress approve the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill?
" Couldn‚Äôt agree more! We‚Äôre making this change soon. Main timeline should allow for an easy sideways swipe between top, latest, trending and topics that you follow. Twitter search nav already sorta does this after you search."
" In simple terms: As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop."
 Go back and read your old Securities Analysis 101 textbook
 Tweets that are interesting or entertaining get traction. That‚Äôs why writers tend to do well on Twitter.
" Please tell us your great ideas, Ross ‚Ä¶"
" This has gone too far, to say the least! what is your explanation for this madness?"
 Why has the mainstream media refused to report on this?
 Interesting. Suggest that maybe we might still have an itsy bitsy bot problem on Twitter ‚Ä¶
Newspapers just search the Internet and print it out ‚Äì SJM
"As (outgoing) Chair of House Intelligence, did you approve hidden state censorship in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States "
" If you know the solution is a whole number, doing mental cube approximations &amp; guessing works great"
 Your tax dollars at work ‚Ä¶
Government paid Twitter millions of dollars to censor info from the public
"Other social media companies too, not just Twitter"
 How do you calculate 90%?
 The United States has definitely been harmed by having her as a senator lol
 How did it come to be this way?

 Good point. Twitter will make that change.
 Why do so few report about millions of people crossing the border?
Those who want power are the ones who least deserve it
 No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.
 You must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?
"As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it"
" The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive"
Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.
"Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won‚Äôt happen again."
 Paul‚Äôs account will be restored shortly
" Policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that account‚Äôs *primary* purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule"
" Ok, that seems reasonable"
 What do you think should be the policy?
" Casually sharing occasional links is fine, but no more relentless advertising of competitors for free, which is absurd in the extreme"
" Exactly. Twitter should be easy to use, but no more relentless free advertising of competitors. No traditional publisher allows this and neither will Twitter."

 Temp suspension due to prior doxxing action by this account. Will be lifted shortly.
" Agreed, a high priority software update for Twitter is showing the reason for account suspension or deboosting. Rules should be equally &amp; consistently applied."
 Maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 The tide is turning fast for the Faucists
 Because they‚Äôre in on it
 They abandon even the pretense of noble principles in their zeal to keep their monopoly on information seen by the public
" There will be multiple algorithms, including no algorithm (ie just tweets from those you follow in chronological order)"
"True creation eventually becomes independent of its creator. Evolution takes the original product far from its origin, with an uncertain outcome.‚Äì Dune, The Machine Crusade"
 üßê Much will come to light as Fauci loses power.
 The journalists were aware of the violent stalker and yet still doxxed the real-time location of my family. Turns out that‚Äôs a criminal offense ‚Ä¶
 Absolutely. Free speech is the bedrock of Democracy.
" Congressman Lieu, were you aware of this program and did you approve it? Simple questions require simple answers."

Congrats to SpaceX Team on 3 perfect orbital launches within 36 hours!!!
"In addition, Twitter will make it easier to see tweets from just those you follow, as well as other tweet curations"
 Wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media 
" If a group of accounts engages in ‚Äúbrigading‚Äù, the entire group of accounts will get a credibility score of zero, so their actions will be ineffective"
" If an account engages in large-scale blocking, the value of a block signal from that account will trend to zero"
 A two day suspension of maybe 7 accounts for doxxing got an actual Wikipedia page!? Wikipedia is controlled by the MSM journalists. Can‚Äôt trust that site anymore.
"To be clear, all user actions will factor into a NN model for a tweet and the account tweeting, including positive actions.¬†As user accounts develop credibility, their actions will have greater weight, similar to how works."
 Changing name or profile pic causes checkmark to disappear until account is reviewed by Twitter support team for impersonation
 Olbermann tweeting from his dog‚Äôs account still makes me lmao
" Quite frankly, a few days away from Twitter is good for their mental health"
 Interesting. This seems to have happened in every country.
" Securities Analysis 101As the ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù real rate of return from Treasury Bills approaches the much riskier rate of return from stocks, the value of stocks drop.For example, if T-bills and stocks both had a 10% rate of return, everyone would just buy the former."
Twitter will start incorporating mute &amp; block signals from Blue Verified (not Legacy Blue) as downvotes
The people have spoken.Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now.
" Indeed, there is no other reason"
 Such shameful behavior will not be tolerated going forward
 Too many people have lost faith in the future. A new philosophy is needed.
" Weird, Markoff blocked me"

"Meanwhile, Twitter usage (by real humans) once again reaches all-time highs"
" Rather than rigorously pursuing truth, you are virtue-signaling to show that you are ‚Äúgood‚Äù in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds"
" The danger of training AI to be woke ‚Äì in other words, lie ‚Äì is deadly"
" Bari, this is a real question, not rhetorical. What is your opinion?"
 Twitter is not the real world
 That‚Äôs what they are saying
 Exactly. Same rules for all.
" Potentially, the biggest financial crisis ever"
"And soon, ladies &amp; gentlemen, the coup de gr√¢ce"
" Things are rather intense right now, but maybe closer to Christmas"
" What should the consequence of doxxing someone‚Äôs real-time, exact location be? Assume your child is at that location, as mine was."
 One day of Twitter suspension ‚â† death

"If anyone posted real-time locations &amp; addresses of NYT reporters, FBI would be investigating, there‚Äôd be hearings on Capitol Hill &amp; Biden would give speeches about end of democracy!"
Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
"  Yeah, we will add that feature. Current system isn‚Äôt clear.A time delay on reporting location that doesn‚Äôt put people at serious risk of being killed is fine."
 Accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary 7 day suspension
 7 day suspension for doxxing. Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul ‚Ä¶
" They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service"
I love Barbara Streisand lol
" Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not"
 Same doxxing rules apply to ‚Äújournalists‚Äù as to everyone else
" Yup, recent events make that super clear!"
" Twitter obviously must be fair to all, so will aim to stop violent extremism being promoted by any group"
Anyone recognize this person or car? https://t.co/2U0Eyx7iwl
"Last night, car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving &amp; climbed onto hood.Legal action is being taken against Sweeney &amp; organizations who supported harm to my family."
"Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn‚Äôt a safety problem, so is ok."
" Real-time posting of someone else‚Äôs location violates doxxing policy, but delayed posting of locations are ok"
 Up to 7 days for human review

 Yes. His explanation was ‚Ä¶unconvincing.
" In light of concerns about Baker‚Äôs possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today"

So many interesting posts on Twitter these days!
 The ads are also way too big. We‚Äôll fix it this week.

" Electric cargo ships are straightforward, as are short to medium range electric aircraft. Long-range aircraft (beyond ~1500 mile) will take a few more years."
 Team was a bit too intense with spam/bot suspensions. Moving to chill mode.

 The Constitution is greater than any President. End of story.
 I take that as a compliment!
" You do, that‚Äôs the fundamental difference"
"The intelligence of this hive-mind will improve significantly as signal/noise, effective cross-linking of tweets &amp; speed of tweets all improve"
" More importantly, they said nothing about ChatGPT! Totally üò¥ at the üöÉ."
Anything anyone says will be used against me in a court of law
" Not surprising, as I just learned that OpenAI had access to Twitter database for training. I put that on pause for now. Need to understand more about governance structure &amp; revenue plans going forward.OpenAI was started as open-source &amp; non-profit. Neither are still true."
 The delayed reaction of regular news is like nonstop d√©j√† vu

 Worth mentioning that Tesla has open-sourced its charge connector and is enabling other EVs to use Tesla Superchargers
 Or you can just buy a Tesla
 I kinda like this post tbh
 Remember that 2022 flicking tiger‚Äôs nuts meme I posted? Well ‚Ä¶

Great work by Twitter Spaces team!
Looks like we will need another day or so
" Wow. Meanwhile, on Twitter ‚Ä¶"
Pretty wild that you can engage in back-and-forth dialogue with over 100k people live on Twitter Spaces!
" And, in doing so, destroy their credibility"
"I am not expressing an opinion, but did promise to conduct this poll.Should Assange and Snowden be pardoned?"
Just a note to thank advertisers for returning to Twitter
 Let‚Äôs throw a party and invite the whole galaxy!
 Agreed. Let‚Äôs just give him an adult timeout in the big house &amp; move on.
SBF was bad at League. Nuff said.
 That‚Äôs because ChatGPT is not a far left cause. The New York Times should rename itself The Social Justice Times.
 is super important for getting closer to truth
 ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.
 Thank you for helping with this important problem
 ChatGPT is so much better at bullshit than they are!
" That is because The New York Times has become, for all intents and purposes, an unregistered lobbying firm for far left politicians"
" That‚Äôs just the publicly disclosed number. His actual support of Dem elections is probably over $1B. The money went somewhere, so where did it go?"
" I‚Äôve seen a lot of concerning tweets about the recent Brazil election. If those tweets are accurate, it‚Äôs possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates."
Twitter servers are running at Warp 9!! https://t.co/vtZZeKupC7
 The safety of any AI system can be measured by its MtH (meantime to Hitler). Microsoft‚Äôs Tay chatbot of several years ago got there in ~24 hours.
 Haha pretty close. Electrical closet.
 Funny thing is that there was actually a little fire at Twitter HQ earlier this week! Whole building was evacuated.
 ü•∞ü•∞I recently learned that OpenAI receives a lot of its data from Twitter
 Some things are priceless ‚Ä¶
Tune in for Episode 2 of The Twitter Files tomorrow!
 Transparency is the key to trust
" Twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a 1st amendment violation, but acting under orders from the government to suppress free speech, with no judicial review, is"
" If this isn‚Äôt a violation of the Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment, what is?"
 It was an honor to see you again. Looking forward to exciting plans in France!
"We‚Äôre double-checking some facts, so probably start live tweeting in about 40 mins"
 Oh you mean the same MSM that all colluded to suppress the story? That MSM?
What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!
 Both false positives and negatives matter
Please screenshot examples that Twitter needs to fix
Not counting those behind the ‚Äúsee more replies‚Äù aka probable spam button
"Major Twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spam/scam accounts.Taking just past 24 hours, does it seem like there are far fewer?"
Twitter is now serving almost 90 billion tweet impressions per day!Just how incredibly alive the system actually is will become obvious as we show view count on all tweets.
"There are about 500M tweets per day &amp; billions of impressions, so hate speech impressions are &lt;0.1% of what‚Äôs seen on Twitter!"
" We will publish stats on Love Speech too, as it is vastly higher than Hate Speech!"
"Hate speech impressions (# of times tweet was viewed) continue to decline, despite significant user growth! will publish data weekly.Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt mean freedom of reach. Negativity should &amp; will get less reach than positivity. https://t.co/36zl29rCSM"
" Please report accounts doing so. Repeated harassment falls into the spam category, so will result in a temp suspension."
 That resulted in a major spike. Twitter will be publishing actual ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù (same list company has always used) impressions later today &amp; every week going forward.
 The (currently) quiet majority should tweet more!
"You know Twitter is being fair when extremists on far right and far left are simultaneously upset!Twitter aims to serve center 80% of people, who wish to learn, laugh &amp; engage in reasoned debate. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
" Current efficiency is 1.7kWh/mile, but there is a clear path to 1.6, possibly 1.5"
 I have Sam Gamgee‚Äôs words on my bedside table
" Just clarifying that his account is being suspended for incitement to violence, not an unflattering pic of me being hosed by Ari. Frankly, I found those pics to be helpful motivation to lose weight!"
" I tried my best. Despite that, he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended."
 This is silly. Only two numbers are needed to calculate range: battery energy density and average vehicle energy consumed per unit distance.

 How many views do your tweets get?
" We aren‚Äôt doing well at surfacing tweets from less prominent handles, as it‚Äôs almost impossible to distinguish between authentic humans vs bots/trolls. This is why $8/month with phone and optional ID verification, as well as organizational affiliation, is so important."
AI is getting really good
 Exactly. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm encouraging people to interact with Twitter more!
" Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I‚Äôve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!"
" View count will show how many people actually see tweets, just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!"
" The problem is that likes are public, subjecting people to criticism, and ‚Äúlike‚Äù is often the wrong description, as you often just think something is interesting or notable, but not likable. We need to add these critical distinctions."
" Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets, just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem."
 Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)? Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%.
"I meet so many people who read twitter every day, but almost never tweet.If I may beg your indulgence, please add your voice to the public dialogue!"
Lot of people stuck in a damn-that‚Äôs-crazy ChatGPT loop üîÅ
" There still isn‚Äôt a good strawberry picking robot, but researchers are working on it.As they apply AI to maximizing how many strawberries get picked, it might do whatever it takes to get more &amp; more planted, until eventually there are strawberry fields forever ‚Ä¶"
"As a reminder, tap the stars icon on upper right of screen to switch between latest people you follow and recommended tweets"
 Always wondered about that bear ‚Ä¶
"Twitter is purging a lot of spam/scam accounts right now, so you may see your follower count drop"
" We are now confident that the Neuralink device is ready for humans, so timing is a function of working through the FDA approval process"
Exciting Neuralink update in 30 mins!
"Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so."
 Cancel culture needs to be canceled!!
" Wow, thank you for the kind words "
 Feels like an eternity ago
Thanks for taking me around Apple‚Äôs beautiful HQ https://t.co/xjo4g306gR
" Exactly. The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."
 Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.
" Much more, but I am simply stating the obvious"
 We‚Äôre implementing anti-bot bots. You should see some improvement by tomorrow.
Microservices ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/w6K0t1SRRs
Twitter core services latency reduced by ~400ms. Should feel noticeably faster.

" Several other major Democrat politicians attacked me too, all around the same time. It was coordinated.Outside of party leadership and independents like Manchin, they are essentially actors on the political stage, not directors or script writers."
 Sam used to be so rational! There is such a thing as too much meditation ‚Ä¶
" Don‚Äôt love the name, but the drink itself is amazing &amp; brings me joy üòÄ"
 This is a serious problem
"If Community Notes can correct me, then obviously they can correct anyone. This is a good example. They were right to add the label."
 I think I have been very specific
 It‚Äôs a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
 The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!Satire is reveals a deeper truth.
 This will forever be our top priority
"This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead."
" This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead."
" Absolutely, especially if done in collusion with the government"
The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened ‚Ä¶
 Why are so many in the media against free speech? This is messed up.
 A revolution against online censorship in America
 Support is greatly appreciated!
" Wow, they don‚Äôt sound biased at all!"
Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?
"Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won‚Äôt tell us why"
 Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers
 Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla?
Who else has Apple censored?
Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?
"Greetings, I‚Äôm Musket, Elon Musket"

The amount of pro psy ops on Twitter is ridiculous! At least with new Verified they will pay $8 for the privilege haha.
 Your anti-dictator stance is as controversial as it is brave. From whence cometh your üí∞?
 I‚Äôm optimistic that we will make some progress
" That American media would argue *against* free speech in America ‚Äì within the bounds of the law ‚Äì is an utter travesty.Shame on them! Shame, shame, shame."
" That might be cool to show publicly, now that you mention it"
 You probably weren‚Äôt blocking 4000 accounts per second
 Friends have asked me if there‚Äôs a way to recover their old vine videos! Will look into it.
 System obviously needs immediate alerts for any sudden spike in database writes of any kind
 That‚Äôs literally how I found out!
Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.
 This whole thread is making your point for you
And I am paying $8 btw :)
"Just a note to encourage people of different political or other views to engage in civil debate on Twitter. Worst case, the other side has a slightly better understanding of your views."
" Remote is fine, but the bar for excellence &amp; trust is higher to overcome communication difficulties"

 ArtCenter College of Design gave me an honorary degree for my work on the original Tesla Roadster
" More importantly, I was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster. Eberhard was wealthy and could have risked his money, but was unwilling to do so."
